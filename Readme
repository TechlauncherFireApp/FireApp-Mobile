### ISOLATED INSTALL
1. Install Docker Desktop
    * Windows Instructions: href/link
    * MacOS Instructions: href/link
2. Install an android emulator 
    * Android Studio (Android Virtual Machine)
        - If using a AMD based Windows computer 
            1. you will need to enable "Windows HyperVisor Platform"
            2. Hyper-V MUST be ENABLED in bios/uefi for Docker to work
    * Visual Studio Emulator for Android
        - a more lightweight version of the Android Studio one, try this if having issues with android studio
3. Install VSCode & Remote Container externsion (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED but can install anothe IDE if you prefer)
    if using a different IDE such as Intellij, PyCharm, Android Studio, etc - see instructions for that software
    PyCharm - https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html 
    JetBraims Space/IntelliJ - https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/set-up-a-dev-evnvironment.html#using-the-default-dev-environment
3. Clone Repo
4. VSCode Remote Container - Open folder in container 

Connect to emulator:
1. Start the emulator on your local machine
2. In the docker container terminal type `adb tcpip 5555`
3. Device not found may pop up - if so just ignore it
4. Type `adb connect host.docker.internal:5555`
5. Wait for the emulator to connect
6. Run the project using `flutter run` from within the fireapp dir 

adb connect host.docker.internal:5555

Note: VSCode Extensions need to be installed in both the local and container - see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers #Managing extensions for more detail

To emulate iOS you will have to install Flutter locally on a MacOS Machine. Given that Arm based Mac's can't run android & only Mac's can run iOS. I have included instructions for how to complete a local setup below:
